# dotfiles

My environment configuration files.

## Quick Start

The below assumes the current operating system is MacOS.

### Dependencies

There are a few programs the install scripts expect to exist.

#### Fish (Required)

The installation/setup scripts are written using the Fish scripting language.
Therefore, the Fish must be installed and be the shell in which said scripts are
run.

#### Hammerspoon (Optional)

These dotfiles include configuration for Hammerspoon and symlinks said
configuration in the appropriate location.

Therefore it's expected that Hammerspoon be installed, but it isn't essential
for the install script to succeed, making it an optional dependency.

### Setup
